### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a CS PhD candidate at [UMA](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/) focused on machine learning and computer vision. I also contribute to open-source libraries and projects, such as AdapterHub's [Adapter-Transformers](https://github.com/adapter-hub/adapter-transformers) where I contributed [BEiT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08254) (by Microsoft Research). Here, I share research code and personal projects (e.g. [DQN](https://github.com/jannik-brinkmann/dqn)).
